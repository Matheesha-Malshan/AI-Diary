AI‑Diary

A personal AI‑powered journaling application that lets users create, store, and retrieve diary entries using text, images, and voice — backed by a modern Java Spring Boot API and a web frontend.

🚀 Overview

AI‑Diary is built to help users capture life moments — whether written, spoken, or visual — and later search by date or keywords. It’s structured to be extendable with AI features like semantic search and conversational recall in future versions.
